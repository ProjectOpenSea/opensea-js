# Installation

Node.js version 16 is the minimum required for the SDK. If you have Node Version Manager (nvm), run `nvm use 16`.

Then in your project, run:

```bash
npm install --save opensea-js
# or
yarn add opensea-js
```

# Initialization

To get started, first [request an API key](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-keys). Note the terms of use for using API data. API keys are not needed for testnets.

Then, create a new OpenSeaSDK client using your web3 provider:

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { OpenSeaSDK, Chain } from "opensea-js";

// This example provider won't let you make transactions, only read-only calls:
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  "https://mainnet.infura.io",
);

const openseaSDK = new OpenSeaSDK(walletWithProvider, {
  chain: Chain.Mainnet,
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
});
```

## Wallet

Using the example provider above won't let you authorize transactions, which are needed when approving and trading assets and currency. To make transactions, you need a provider with a private key or mnemonic set:

```typescript
const walletWithProvider = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

const openseaSDK = new OpenSeaSDK(walletWithProvider, {
  chain: Chain.Mainnet,
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
});
```

In a browser with web3 or an extension like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), you can use `window.ethereum` to access the native provider.

## Testnets

For testnets, please use `Chain.Goerli` or `Chain.Sepolia`. Rinkeby was deprecated in 2022, and Goerli will be deprecated by January 2024.
