### Fetching Assets

Assets are items on OpenSea. They can be non-fungible (conforming to standards like ERC721), semi-fungible (like ERC1155 assets), and even fungible (ERC20).

Assets are represented by the `Asset` type, defined in TypeScript:

```TypeScript
/**
 * Simple, unannotated non-fungible asset spec
 */
export interface Asset {
  // The asset's token ID, or null if ERC-20
  tokenId: string | null,
  // The asset's contract address
  tokenAddress: string,
  // The schema name (defaults to "ERC721") for this asset
  tokenStandard?: TokenStandard,
  // Optional for ENS names
  name?: string,
  // Optional for fungible items
  decimals?: number
}
```

The `Asset` type is the minimal type you need for most marketplace actions. `TokenStandard` is optional. If omitted, most actions will assume you're referring to a non-fungible, ERC721 asset. Other options include 'ERC20' and 'ERC1155'. You can import `import { TokenStandard } from "opensea-js/lib/types"` to get the full range of schemas supported.

You can fetch an asset using the `OpenSeaAPI`, which will return an `OpenSeaAsset` for you (`OpenSeaAsset` extends `Asset`):

```TypeScript
const asset: OpenSeaAsset = await openseaSDK.api.getAsset({
  tokenAddress, // string
  tokenId, // string | number | BigNumber | null
})
```

Note that fungible ERC20 assets have `null` as their token id.

#### Checking Balances and Ownerships

The nice thing about the `Asset` type is that it unifies logic between fungibles, non-fungibles, and semi-fungibles.

Once you have an `Asset`, you can see how many any account owns, regardless of whether it's an ERC-20 token or a non-fungible good:

```typescript
const asset = {
  tokenAddress: "0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d", // CryptoKitties
  tokenId: "1", // Token ID
};

const balance = await openseaSDK.getBalance({
  accountAddress, // string
  asset, // Asset
});

const ownsKitty = balance.greaterThan(0);
```

### Making Offers

Once you have your asset, you can do this to make an offer on it:

```typescript
// Token ID and smart contract address for a non-fungible token:
const { tokenId, tokenAddress } = YOUR_ASSET;
// The offerer's wallet address:
const accountAddress = "0x1234...";

const offer = await openseaSDK.createBuyOrder({
  asset: {
    tokenId,
    tokenAddress,
    tokenStandard, // TokenStandard. If omitted, defaults to 'ERC721'. Other options include 'ERC20' and 'ERC1155'
  },
  accountAddress,
  // Value of the offer, in units of the payment token (or wrapped ETH if none is specified):
  startAmount: 1.2,
});
```

When you make an offer on an item owned by an OpenSea user, **that user will automatically get an email notifying them with the offer amount**, if it's above their desired threshold.

#### Offer Limits

Note: The total value of buy orders must not exceed 1000 x wallet balance.

### Making Listings / Selling Items

To sell an asset, call `createSellOrder`. You can do a fixed-price listing, where `startAmount` is equal to `endAmount`, or a declining [Dutch auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction), where `endAmount` is lower and the price declines until `expirationTime` is hit:

```typescript
// Expire this auction one day from now.
// Note that we convert from the JavaScript timestamp (milliseconds):
const expirationTime = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000 + 60 * 60 * 24);

const listing = await openseaSDK.createSellOrder({
  asset: {
    tokenId,
    tokenAddress,
  },
  accountAddress,
  startAmount: 3,
  // If `endAmount` is specified, the order will decline in value to that amount until `expirationTime`. Otherwise, it's a fixed-price order:
  endAmount: 0.1,
  expirationTime,
});
```

The units for `startAmount` and `endAmount` are Ether, ETH. If you want to specify another ERC-20 token to use, see [Using ERC-20 Tokens Instead of Ether](#using-erc-20-tokens-instead-of-ether).

See [Listening to Events](#listening-to-events) to respond to the setup transactions that occur the first time a user sells an item.

#### Creating English Auctions

English Auctions are auctions that start at a small amount (we recommend even doing 0!) and increase with every bid. At expiration time, the item sells to the highest bidder.

To create an English Auction set `englishAuction` to `true`:

```typescript
// Create an auction to receive Wrapped Ether (WETH). See note below.
const paymentTokenAddress = "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2";

const startAmount = 0; // The minimum amount to sell for, in normal units (e.g. ETH)

const auction = await openseaSDK.createSellOrder({
  asset: {
    tokenId,
    tokenAddress,
  },
  accountAddress,
  startAmount,
  expirationTime,
  paymentTokenAddress,
  englishAuction: true,
});
```

Note that auctions aren't supported with Ether directly due to limitations in Ethereum, so you have to use an ERC20 token, like Wrapped Ether (WETH), a stablecoin like DAI, etc. See [Using ERC-20 Tokens Instead of Ether](#using-erc-20-tokens-instead-of-ether) for more info.

### Fetching Orders

To retrieve a list of offers and auctions on an asset, you can use an instance of the `OpenSeaAPI` exposed on the client. Parameters passed into API filter objects are camel-cased and serialized before being sent as [OpenSea API parameters](https://docs.opensea.io/v2.0/reference):

```typescript
// Get offers (bids), a.k.a. orders where `side == 0`
const { orders, count } = await openseaSDK.api.getOrders({
  assetContractAddress: tokenAddress,
  tokenId,
  side: "bid",
});

// Get page 2 of all auctions, a.k.a. orders where `side == 1`
const { orders, count } = await openseaSDK.api.getOrders(
  {
    assetContractAddress: tokenAddress,
    tokenId,
    side: "ask",
  },
  2,
);
```

Note that the listing price of an asset is equal to the `currentPrice` of the **lowest valid sell order** on the asset. Users can lower their listing price without invalidating previous sell orders, so all get shipped down until they're canceled, or one is fulfilled.

To learn more about signatures, makers, takers, listingTime vs createdTime and other kinds of order terminology, please read the [**Terminology Section**](https://docs.opensea.io/reference#terminology) of the API Docs.

The available API filters for the orders endpoint is documented in the `OrdersQueryOptions` interface below, but see the main [API Docs](https://docs.opensea.io/reference#reference-getting-started) for a playground, along with more up-to-date and detailed explanations.

```TypeScript
/**
   * Attrs used by orderbook to make queries easier
   */
  side: "bid" | "ask", // "bid" for buy orders, "ask" for sell orders
  protocol?: "seaport"; // Protocol of the order (more options may be added in future)
  maker?: string, // Address of the order's creator
  taker?: string, // The null address if anyone is allowed to take the order
  owner?: string, // Address of owner of the order's item
  assetContractAddress?: string, // Contract address for order's item
  paymentTokenAddress?: string; // Contract address for order's payment token
  tokenId?: number | string,
  tokenIds?: Array<number | string>,
  listedAfter?: number | string, // This means listing_time > value in seconds
  listedBefore?: number | string, // This means listing_time <= value in seconds
  orderBy?: "created_date" | "eth_price", // Field to sort results by
  orderDirection?: "asc" | "desc", // Sort direction of orderBy sorting of results
  onlyEnglish?: boolean, // Only return english auction orders

  // For pagination
  limit?: number,
  offset?: number,
```

### Buying Items

To buy an item, you need to **fulfill a sell order**. To do that, it's just one call:

```typescript
const order = await openseaSDK.api.getOrder({ side: "ask", ... })
const accountAddress = "0x..." // The buyer's wallet address, also the taker
const transactionHash = await openseaSDK.fulfillOrder({ order, accountAddress })
```

Note that the `fulfillOrder` promise resolves when the transaction has been confirmed and mined to the blockchain. To get the transaction hash before this happens, add an event listener (see [Listening to Events](#listening-to-events)) for the `TransactionCreated` event.

If the order is a sell order (`order.side === "ask"`), the taker is the _buyer_ and this will prompt the buyer to pay for the item(s).

### Accepting Offers

Similar to fulfilling sell orders above, you need to fulfill a buy order on an item you own to receive the tokens in the offer.

```typescript
const order = await openseaSDK.api.getOrder({ side: "bid", ... })
const accountAddress = "0x..." // The owner's wallet address, also the taker
await openseaSDK.fulfillOrder({ order, accountAddress })
```

If the order is a buy order (`order.side === "bid"`), then the taker is the _owner_ and this will prompt the owner to exchange their item(s) for whatever is being offered in return. See [Listening to Events](#listening-to-events) below to respond to the setup transactions that occur the first time a user accepts a bid.
