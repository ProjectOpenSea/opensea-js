# Overview

This is the JavaScript SDK for [OpenSea](https://opensea.io), the largest marketplace for NFTs.

It allows developers to access the official orderbook, filter it, create buy orders (**offers**), create sell orders (**listings**), and complete trades programmatically.

Get started by [requesting an API key](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-keys) and instantiating your own OpenSea SDK instance. Then you can create orders off-chain or fulfill orders on-chain, and listen to events in the process.

Happy seafaring! ⛵️
