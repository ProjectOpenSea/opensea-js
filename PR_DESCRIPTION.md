# Pull Request: Enhance Order Fulfillment for Collection Offers

## 🎯 Overview

This PR enhances the `FulfillmentManager.fulfillOrder()` method to better handle collection offers and criteria-based orders by improving API integration, extraData handling, and error management.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced API Integration

- **Problem**: Collection offers weren't properly using API-returned order data
- **Solution**: Method now properly uses API-returned order parameters and extraData for Seaport fulfillment
- **Impact**: More reliable collection offer fulfillment

### 2. Improved ExtraData Handling

- **Problem**: Limited support for extracting extraData from different API response formats
- **Solution**: Added robust support for both `advancedOrder` and `orders` formats with type safety
- **Impact**: Better compatibility with different API response structures

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult
- **Solution**: Added descriptive error messages with context
- **Impact**: Better developer experience and easier debugging

### 4. Type Safety Improvements

- **Problem**: Potential runtime errors from invalid extraData types
- **Solution**: Added strict type checking for extraData extraction
- **Impact**: More robust code with fewer runtime errors
