**Contributor:** [George]  
**Date:** [2025-10-17]  
**Issue/PR:** [https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js/issues/1795]

#### Summary

Enhanced the `FulfillmentManager.fulfillOrder()` method to better handle collection offers and criteria-based orders by:

1. **Improved API Integration**: The method now properly uses API-returned order data for criteria-based fulfillments, ensuring that collection offers are fulfilled with the correct asset details.

2. **Enhanced ExtraData Handling**: Added robust support for extracting `extraData` from API responses in both `advancedOrder` and `orders` formats, with proper type safety checks.

3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages for private listings and added more descriptive error context.

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added extensive test cases covering:
   - API response handling with different data formats
   - Edge cases for extraData extraction
   - Type safety validation
   - Error scenarios

#### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**

- `src/sdk/fulfillment.ts` - Enhanced order fulfillment logic
- `test/sdk/fulfillmentManager.spec.ts` - Added comprehensive test coverage

**Key Changes:**

- Enhanced `extraData` extraction with type safety checks
- Improved API response handling for criteria-based orders
- Better error messages and validation
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

**Benefits:**

- More reliable collection offer fulfillment
- Better error handling and user experience
- Improved type safety and code quality
- Enhanced test coverage for edge cases

#### Usage Example

```typescript
// Fulfill a collection offer for a specific NFT
const txHash = await fulfillmentManager.fulfillOrder({
  order: collectionOffer,
  accountAddress: "0xSeller",
  assetContractAddress: "0xNFT",
  tokenId: "123",
});
```

#### Testing

All new functionality is covered by comprehensive unit tests that verify:

- Proper API response handling
