# opensea-js

## 8.1.0

- b3a5e84: Add drops endpoints, trending/top collections, and account resolve

  - api-types: Sync OpenAPI spec with 6 new endpoints and 8 new schemas (drops, trending/top collections, account resolve)
  - SDK: New DropsAPI class, extended CollectionsAPI and AccountsAPI with new methods
  - CLI: New `drops` command, `collections trending/top` subcommands, `accounts resolve` subcommand

### Patch Changes

- f82c035: Replace hardcoded chain ID maps with codegen from OpenSea REST API

  - SDK: Fix Blast chain ID from 238 (testnet) to 81457 (mainnet)
  - CLI: Add chains previously only in SDK (b3, flow, ronin, etc.)
  - CLI: Remove `bsc`, `sepolia`, `base_sepolia`, `monad_testnet` from `CHAIN_IDS` — these are not in the OpenSea API
  - Add `pnpm sync-chains` codegen script (fetches GET /api/v2/chains as source of truth)

- Updated dependencies [b3a5e84]
  - @opensea/api-types@0.2.0
